This app is was an exercise with react router. A persistent navigation bar displays the cart quantity for the user and reusable components allowed for easy inventory updates. This was also a learning experience with React Testing Library. Learning React Testing Library requires a change in thinking about how to approach development and extra time to produce thorough code. Ultimately, I plan on increasing my proficiency with testing as it a skill that will cement my knowledge of development and increase my confidence to produce reliable code.
